I wrote a simple [app](/standalone/chord_trainer/) that I wrote to help with
ear training. It's built on top of a fork of Andrey Bundin's
[Open Web Piano](https://github.com/iBundin/Open-Web-Piano).

The app repeatedly plays a chord with a random root and quality, and the task is
to figure out what the chord is and what scales you can play on top of it.
