Testing out Jekyll.

```ts
// Some TypeScript code.
export class Foo {
  constructor(s: string) {
    console.log(s);
  }
}
```

This is pretty neat, it only took a few hours to get up and running, including
exporting all my old blog posts from WordPress (though I haven't set up
comments yet).

*update:* hooking up comments to GitHub only took another hour.

<script>
  console.log('hello');
</script>
