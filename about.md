Hi, I'm Tom Madams and this is my blog.

I currently work at Google for their on-device machine intelligence team.

Some of the more interesting things I've been lucky enough to work on in the past:
 - At Google:
   - Wrote the C++ engine for [Minigo][minigo], an open-source implementation
     of the AlphaGo Zero algorithm. Minigo is currently the reinforcement
     learning benchmark in the [MLPerf][ml-perf] suite, and is also available
     as a demo for Google's [Coral][coral] Edge TPU accelerator.
   - Built the Google-side data ingestion pipeline for a [collaboration][tae]
     between Google and TAE Technologies, a clean energy company working
     towards building a commercially viable plasma fusion reactor.
   - A minor contribution to a much larger effort to
     [automatically diagnose diabetic retinopathy][retinopathy]
     using machine learning (I wrote the tool used to annotate retina
     photographs). The corresponding research paper was named by [The Journal
     of the American Medical Association][jama-decade] as one of the ten
     most important medical papers of the decade, which was pretty cool.
   - Spent a few years on the search infrastructure team, where I rewrote one of
     the result ranking frameworks that had lasted from Google's early
     "10 blue links" days.

 - At LucasArts:
   - Worked on the asset packing & streaming system, and wrote a new decal system
     for [Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II][tfu-ii].
   - Collaborated with LucasFilm engineers to prototype a realtime, low-latency
     motion capture preview system leveraging the LucasArts game engine.
   - Also worked on a couple of unreleased titles.

 - At Sony's London Studio (then, Team Soho):
   - Wrote the traffic system for [The Getaway][getaway] and its sequel,
     The Getaway: Black Monday. I also took ownership of the graphics engine
     after the original author left the company and added a number of features,
     optimizations and effects.
   - Was one of the rendering engineers for an unreleased PlayStation 3
     iteration of [The Getaway][getaway-ps3]. The highlight of that somewhat
     difficult time was building a demo for the PlayStation 3 reveal at E3 2005.
